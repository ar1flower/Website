    	<li>
        	<h3>Wear sunscreen!</h3>

        	<h3>Keep the skincare routine simple!</h3>
            <p>An overcomplicated skincare routine can irritate, especially to sensitive skin types. Try to stick to unscented products with simple fomulations. The Ordinary is a great brand for this!</p>

        	<h3>Head & Shoulders is a good face mask!</h3>
	<p>Head & Shoulders shampoo is approved by many dermatologists to use as a face mask! It is anti-bacterial and helps reduce fungal acne. Refrain from using it on your hair because the formulation is strong and may cause damage.</p>

        	<h3>Drink plenty of water!</h3>
          <p>It may seem obvious but drinking water is one of the best things you can do for your body. It clears your skin and helps your digestive system flush toxins from your body. Overall, you'll look and feel great!</p>
